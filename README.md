# Core Java Projects 

This repository contains my practice and learning projects as I grow my skills in Core Java and backend development.

As a Java trainee and final-year Computer Science student, I'm using this space to build, learn, and showcase real-world logic using Java.

##  What You'll Find Here
- OOPs-based mini projects
- Java console applications
- File handling examples
- Java Collections practice
- JDBC and database integration (coming soon)

## Planned & Ongoing Projects

- [ ] Student Record Management System
- [ ] Bank Account Console App
- [ ] To-Do List App (Menu-based)
- [ ] Grade Calculator
- [ ] Basic Quiz Game
Projects will be updated regularly as I continue learning.

## Learning Goals

- Improve Java logic and syntax
- Apply OOP concepts effectively
- Work with ArrayLists, HashMaps, and file I/O
